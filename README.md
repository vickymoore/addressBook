## Description OF Program.

This program is **a book or a database used for storing entries called contacts**. Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name, company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, mobile phone number). It allows users to store details of their personal contacts.

## PROGRAM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS && TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTS {TDD}.

### SETUP:

- Use index.html for home page.
- Used css to style pages (custom styles.css as well as bootstrap).
- Sent valid commits regularly through Github.
- I used javascript to make the page interactive (custom javascript and Jquery)
- And i finally used VS code edittor to add a READme.

### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTS {TDD}:

-----> Describe: Contact()

* Test: It is a constructive function for contact objects, it takes the contact details and stores them as an object.

* Code: let newContact = new Contact("Victor", "Praise", "Opebiyi");  console.log(newContact);

* Expected Output: ContactÂ {firstName: "Victor", middleName: "Praise", lastName: "Opebiyi"}

-----> Describe Contact.prototype.fullName()

* Test: It is a prototypal function under the Contact Constructor which takes the contacts first name and last name, then concatenates them with a space in-between.

* Code: newContact.fullName();

* Expected Output: "Victor Opebiyi"

-----> Describe: PhoneNumber()

* Test: It is a constructive function for phone numbers objects, it takes the number type (mobile, home, work, others) and stores them as an object.

* Code: let newNumber = new PhoneNumber(09138673674, 081031837, 09138673674, 09079850985); console.log(newNumber);

* Expected Output: PhoneNumber {mobile: 09138673674, home: 09029936119, work: 09138673674, other: 09079850985}


-----> Describe Contact.prototype.addNumber()

* Test: This prototypal function assigns a new property to the Contact function with a key phoneNumber and the value as the PhoneNumber object.

* Code: newContact.addNumber(newNumber);

* Expected Output: True

-----> Describe: EmailAddress()

* Test: It is a constructive function for Email objects, it takes the Email type (mobile, home, work, others) and stores them as an object.

* Code: let newEmail = new EmailAddress(victechpoint@gmail.com, praiseopebiyivictor@Gmail.com, victech@yahoo.com, adalovelace@yahoo.com); console.log(newEmail);

* Expected Output: EmailAddress {mobile: victechpoint@gmail.com,  home: praiseopebiyivictor@Gmail.com, work: victech@yahoo.com, other: adalovelace@yahoo}

-----> Describe Contact.prototype.addEmail()

* Test: This prototypal function assigns a new property to the Contact function with a key email and the value as the EmailAddress object.

* Code: newContact.addEmail(newEmail);

* Expected Output: True

-----> Describe: PhysicalAddress()

* Test: It is a constructive function for PhysicalAddress objects, it takes the PhysicalAddress type (home, work, others) and stores them as an object.

* Code: let newAddress = new PhysicalAddress(24 primate ayodele crescent, Bill gates road, Washington Dc off miller's road); console.log(newAddress);

* Expected Output: PhysicalAddress {home: 24 primate ayodele crescent, work: Bill gates road, other: Washington Dc off miller's road}

-----> Describe Contact.prototype.addAddress()

* Test: This prototypal function assigns a new property to the Contact function with a key address and the value as the PhysicalAddress object.

* Code: newContact.addAddress(newAddress);

* Expected Output: True

-----> Describe: AddressBook()

* Description Test: This is a constructive function which stores all Contact in an object, in this case it was used to mock a database it behaves similarly as a database would. It has just two parameters in it({contacts = {}; currentId = 0;}).  It has prototypal functions assigned to it(addContact, assignId, findContact, deleteContact) which would be used to add a contact, assign id to a contact, find a contact, and delete a contact respectively.
